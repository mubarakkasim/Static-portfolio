                            revealing a tapestry of experiences, relationships, and growth. From the inception of "New
                            World, New Memories," to the culmination of "Final Chapter," the journey has been one of
                            self-discovery and transformation.</p>

                        <p>Yet, as the ink dried on the final page of that last volume, I found myself standing at the
                            threshold of the unknown, with countless stories left untold, waiting to be penned. Thus,
                            "Unwritten Chapters" was born—a continuation of my biographical series, a testament to the
                            ever-evolving narrative of my life.</p>

                        <p class="drop-cap">In the echoes of memory and the whispers of nostalgia, I find myself drawn
                            back to the beginning—the year 2016, a time of youth and innocence, when the ink of my pen
                            first graced the blank pages of my biographical series. "New World, New Memories" set the
                            stage for the odyssey that followed, chronicling the adventures, loves, and lessons of my
                            early years. With each turn of the page, I journeyed through the highs and lows of life,
                            navigating the twists and turns of fate with courage and resilience.</p>

                        <p>As the series progressed, so too did I, maturing in both age and wisdom. "Final Chapter"
                            marked a milestone—a reflection on the chapters that had come before, a celebration of
                            growth and accomplishment, and a poignant farewell to a chapter of my life. Yet, even as I
                            bid adieu to that familiar narrative, I knew deep within that the story was far from over.
                        </p>

                        <p>Now, after 1645 days—a span of time filled with moments both mundane and monumental—I stand
                            once more at the precipice of storytelling, poised to continue the remarkable journey that
                            began so many years ago. "Unwritten Chapters" beckons, its pages blank and waiting, eager to
                            be filled with the tales of love, loss, and laughter that have yet to unfold. And so, with
                            pen in hand and heart open wide, I embark on this new adventure, ready to explore the
                            unwritten future that lies ahead.</p>

                        <p>Ending 2019, my life was well-structured and figured, with no issues concerning girls. I
                            applied to the Iya Abubakar Institute of Computing and ICT and simultaneously applied to
                            Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic in Zaria. However, due to the recklessness of café owners, I
                            encountered some trouble while completing my online post UTME screening. This forced me to
                            abandon the admission processes, leaving me with only one option, which was Iya Abubakar. By
                            the end of the year, I went to ABU to write my entrance examination. Within two weeks after
                            the exam, the results came out, and Alhamdulillah, I passed, securing admission into one of
                            the prestigious universities in Nigeria, even though it was a diploma program. Despite this,
                            I was happy with the admission. By December 2019, I had begun preparing to start a new
                            journey after a year without being in a classroom.</p>

                        <p>The anticipation of starting at the Iya Abubakar Institute of Computing and ICT was both
                            exhilarating and daunting. After a year away from formal education, the prospect of diving
                            back into academia was refreshing. The thrill of stepping into a prestigious university,
                            even if for a diploma program, gave me a sense of accomplishment and hope for the future. It
                            felt like a fresh start, an opportunity to redefine my goals and ambitions.</p>

                        <p>During this period of transition, I spent a lot of time reflecting on my journey. The past
                            year had been a rollercoaster of emotions and experiences, but it had also been a period of
                            growth. I had learned to navigate life without the structure and discipline that school
                            provided, and this newfound independence had taught me valuable lessons. Now, with a renewed
                            sense of purpose, I was ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that awaited me at
                            ABU.</p>

                        <p>As late December 2019 approached, I began making preparations for this new chapter in my
                            life. The campus was bustling with energy, filled with students from diverse backgrounds,
                            all with their own dreams and aspirations. The environment was vibrant and full of
                            possibilities, and I couldn’t wait to be a part of it. The idea of attending lectures,
                            participating in group projects, and engaging with lectures and peers was something I
                            eagerly looked forward to.</p>

                        <p>The days leading up to my enrolment were filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness. I
                            gathered all the necessary materials, packed my bags, and mentally prepared myself for the
                            journey ahead. My family, especially my parents, were supportive and proud of my
                            achievements. Their encouragement and belief in my abilities gave me the confidence to step
                            into this new phase of my life with optimism.</p>

                        <p>On the day I set foot on the campus of Iya Abubakar Institute, I felt a surge of pride and
                            determination. This was the beginning of a new era, a chance to build on the foundation I
                            had laid in the past. The campus was vast, with state-of-the-art facilities and a vibrant
                            community of students and faculty. It was everything I had hoped for and more.</p>

                        <p>The first few weeks were a whirlwind of orientation programs, meeting new people, and
                            adjusting to the academic schedule. It was a lot to take in, but I embraced every moment
                            with enthusiasm. The courses were challenging, but I was determined to excel. The faculty
                            was knowledgeable and supportive, always encouraging us to push our boundaries and strive
                            for excellence.</p>

                        <p>As I settled into this new routine, I began to appreciate the beauty of being in an academic
                            environment once again. The structure and discipline of university life brought a sense of
                            order and purpose to my days. I found myself immersed in my studies, eager to learn and
                            grow. The friendships I formed during this period were also invaluable. I met people from
                            different walks of life, each with their own unique perspectives and experiences. These
                            connections enriched my journey and added depth to my understanding of the world.</p>

                        <p>Looking back, the decision to attend the Iya Abubakar Institute was a pivotal moment in my
                            life. It marked the beginning of a transformative journey, one that would shape my future in
                            ways I had never imagined. The challenges and triumphs I encountered along the way were all
                            part of the process, each contributing to my growth and development.</p>

                        <p>This new pace of my life was not just about academic achievement; it was about self-discovery
                            and personal growth. It was about finding my place in the world and understanding what truly
                            mattered to me. The experiences and lessons I gained during this period were invaluable,
                            shaping me into the person I am today. As I continue to navigate the journey of life, I
                            carry with me the wisdom and insights gained during this transformative time at the Iya
